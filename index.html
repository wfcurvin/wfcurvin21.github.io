		<td><strong>Australia</strong></td>
		<td>
			<p>After my sophomore year of college, I was lucky enough to get to study abroad in Australia with other UGA students. <wbr> It </wbr> was only a two month trip, but it was jam-packed with awesome experiences! We were given the chance to tour Sydney, hike through the Daintree Rainforest (<A href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daintree_Rainforest>the world's oldest rainforest</a>), camp in the Outback, and even scuba dive at the Great Barrier Reef! It was an incredible experience and one that I will remember forever.

		<td><strong>Europe</strong></td>
		<td>
			<p>Right before I started college, my family took me on a trip to visit friends in Europe. We were able to visit <wbr>England</wbr>, Germany, Luxemburg, and France while abroad which was really amazing. The public train system in Europe makes it really easy to travel from country to country affordably. </p></td>

		<td> <strong>Florida Keys </strong></td>
		<td>
			<p>While I was a boy scout in high school, a few friends of mine went on a sailing trip through our troop in the Florida keys. Over the course of a week and a half, we cooked all of our meals on the ship and spent every night there. We snorkeled at different coral reefs nearby, and didn't step foot on land the whole time! I learned a lot about knot tying and the proper way to sail which was really cool! At the end of the trip, we went to Key West to explore and get our first good meal in a long time! </p> </td>
